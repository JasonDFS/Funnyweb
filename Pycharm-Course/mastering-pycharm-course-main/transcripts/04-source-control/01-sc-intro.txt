00:2.84 Now that you know all about.
00:4.37 The editor in PyCharm, it's time to take our code and make sure it's
00:8.29 safe and sound. And that means putting it into source control.
00:12.48 So we don't want to lose our work and we want to be able to explore
00:15.42 with abandoned. We want to be able to just make changes and decide,
00:18.81 oh you know what, that didn't work.
00:20.09 So we're just going to roll it back to the last saved version of course.
00:22.95 Source Control is fantastic for that.
00:25.64 If you're working on a team then source Control is almost always the way that teams
00:30.25 collaborate and work together on a single set of files.
00:35.64 One of the things I love about PyCharm is how it takes all the history
00:39.01 and information inside your Source control repo,
00:41.66 whether that's GIT or subversion or whatever in its surfaces.
00:44.93 That back to the editor for example,
00:47.27 just pulling up a file, you'll be able to see what parts have been changed
00:50.31 what's been deleted, what's been added since the last time you did a check
00:54.3 in. Really, really amazing.
00:56.64 So we're gonna look at all those features and we're also going to look at GitHub.
00:59.61  Github and Git is really where the action is today.
01:2.83 Especially get and you'll see that PyCharm is all about working with Git as well
01:7.82 as their special features built in for Git flow that is somebody submits a pull request to
01:13.64 some project that we're working on.
01:15.39 There's ways we can actually see that directly and PyCharm,
01:18.36 check it out, explore it and then emerge that back all from the editor.
01:23.12 Really, really nice way. So let you explore what you're about to merge,
01:26.26 not just have to read the files in GitHub and say,
01:28.46 seems okay, let's go. So the source control features and PyCharm are amazing so lets dug in.
