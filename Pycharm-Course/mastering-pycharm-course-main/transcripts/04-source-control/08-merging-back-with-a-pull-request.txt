00:0.04 So we made our fix to this version to header,
00:3.25 issue 48 branch but it's not actually in our podcast code.
00:8.49 What we want to do is we want to actually create what's called a poor request
00:11.58 Now this is not the way you have to do it.
00:13.7 You can go over in PyCharm and I could go this branch and just say
00:20.66 merge the changes we made into this branch and there would be a unrelated copy of
00:26.15 it dropped over here. Right.
00:28.01 But what we can do is we can put a little bit more formality around it
00:31.92 on github and this is super common,
00:33.87 which is why I show an issue over here is we might create a poor request
00:37.21 somebody wants to review it or have a record for this reason all of these
00:41.91 changes were brought over into this branch.
00:44.54 I'm gonna go ahead and you know,
00:45.55 github is really friendly and it says,
00:47.2 look here's some branches that are not the one you're on and you might want to
00:51.81 create a poor request. I'm going to switch the one I'm actually working on at
00:54.9 the moment and do the same,
00:56.44 then I'll click this button here.
01:0.14 If we look at it, it says we're going to take those changes we did
01:3.04 to that branch and I actually want to put it into this particular branch and it
01:6.84 says great, you can merge those changes automatically.
01:11.14 This will be super. And now we're going to fix say this fix uh fix
01:19.2 says issue 48 with this PR so we can open the poor request,
01:25.74 wait a moment. Then here we have the various changes we've done with our check
01:29.95 in and it's going to fix this now.
01:35.31 It's not yet merged it right.
01:37.16 It's created the poor request and we could assign someone to review it to make sure
01:40.36 everything works. If we had continuous integration setup,
01:42.83 it might run our tests to make sure if this change were brought in,
01:46.03 it's not going to break things and so on.
01:48.47 So what we would do is we push this button to merge those changes over what
01:54.41 we want to do one other thing before we push these changes in here.
01:57.38 So I'm actually not going to push it now.
01:59.07 I want to go back to PyCharm and play with this PR.
02:1.28 A little bit as well.
