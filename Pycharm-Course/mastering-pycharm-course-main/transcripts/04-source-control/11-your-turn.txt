00:0.04 Now that you've seen me work with Source control and local history and so on.
00:3.97 It's your turn. It's time to write some code and get hands on with the
00:8.21 source control features and the local history features of PyCharm.
00:11.63 So jump over to the github repository,
00:14.05 go to the your turn section and then topic number 3.
00:18.02 Source control. So the idea is we're gonna go and build a basic little high
00:23.24 level game to create a local git repository,
00:27.84 make sure you have get installed on your system and then we'll just type git init
00:32.07  in a folder instead of connecting this back to it.
00:34.58 Some kind of cloud place like GIT hub or git bucket or git lab.
00:38.35 We're just going to create a local Git repository.
00:40.94 And in here we're going to write some code.
00:42.62 We're going to write this game that basically allows you to guess the number and uses
00:46.74 was called the binary search algorithm,
00:50.14 ideally you're going to use the binary search algorithm to play it.
00:52.8 So I guess a number between 0 and 100 and 50 too low 75 too high.
00:58.12 You just kind of find your way half between each little segment until you get it
01:2.03 nailed. Right. Then you're going to check this into your local Git repository as
01:6.63 well as play with local history.
01:8.84 So get out there, play with this code,
01:11.07 Make sure you try out. Do you remember it and you know exactly how it works.
