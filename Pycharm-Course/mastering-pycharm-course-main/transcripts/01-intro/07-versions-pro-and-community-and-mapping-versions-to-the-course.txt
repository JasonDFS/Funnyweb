00:0.14 When you go to get PyCharm,
00:2.14 Click the download button and it takes you over here to this download PyCharm with
00:6.79 a fork in the road a choose your own adventure.
00:9.74 Are you going to get the Professional Edition which costs some money or are you going
00:14.08 to get the Community edition? The community edition is free and open source the professional
00:20.12 one, It turns out there's actually a cheaper option if you pick individual uses but
00:26.51 if you're a student or a teacher or you work in an open source project or
00:30.56 the university you can. Not the university but everyone else can have it for free
00:34.95 and then start ups and universities get it at half price or even if you're in
00:38.03 a boot camp. So there's some interesting options of what paid means but there's a
00:42.29 paid version and a free version.
00:44.94 When you go to install it actually use this tool box here.
00:48.35 This toolbox is way nicer than just click which version one,
00:51.17 it keeps you up to date,
00:52.05 you can install early access version alongside your main version and so on.
00:57.24 But what you really want to know is well what do I get if I'm going
00:59.79 to pay for it vs not so over this.
01:2.45 URL Up here,
01:3.6 not really sure to link to it off of their site but you can google it
01:6.61 it will come up or just type it in it will show you what's in
01:9.83 the different versions. So for example you get the code inspections which like the little
01:14.58 fix it, I forgot to import this thing,
01:16.09 you get the de-bugger, you get the console,
01:18.47 you get the refactory, there's a lot in the free version actually,
01:20.93 but for example, not code coverage.
01:23.54 Then over under the main platform,
01:25.61 you don't get things like file watchers.
01:27.3 That's no big deal. But you don't get Perforce.
01:30.26 Probably also not a big deal but there's some stuff like the python web frameworks are
01:34.27 not technically supported now you can still run say Flask or Django from the community edition
01:40.88 but what you don't get is you don't get the integration of say auto complete in
01:45.02 the Jinja template around the Jinja syntax.
01:48.84 You do get html support and notice there's a few other things here star all the
01:53.88 functionality of WebStorm, that's that pyramid that we spoke about earlier or container development
01:59.81 You get a bunch of things in the pro version,
02:1.91 the database stuff plus star, all the functionality from DataGrip,
02:5.21  the scientific tooling, like notebooks and whatnot.
02:8.52 You really get that Only the pro version and you can go to the store already
02:13.0 showed you the pricing. How does that work for the course?
02:16.44 We're going to cover all the features,
02:18.15 the free ones. Most team features the most important features.
02:21.69 Gonna cover the free ones and the paid ones.
02:23.47 So how's that map over? You go over to the course page,
02:27.27 you can actually see here that we have what PyCharm Pro versus PyCharm community
02:32.07 where these maps. So for example in the database section,
02:34.8 we don't have you're gonna have to have the pro version to do the stuff you
02:38.47 see there as well as basically both of the web ones when we do server side
02:43.93 web stuff and client side web stuff.
02:46.14 The profiling is a pro version in the data science tools.
02:49.54 Other than that you should more or less build to do everything with just the community
02:53.51 edition, pick the one that you want.
02:55.26 This is how it maps over to the course content that we're going to go through.
