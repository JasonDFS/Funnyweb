00:0.04 If you're new to Python, you might not realize there's actually multiple run times.
00:4.72 Sometimes they're referred to as Interpreters,
00:6.99 but they don't all interpret. Some of them compile and run as Jit.
00:10.13 So I prefer the term Run Times.
00:12.94 So we have the older Python 2 in the modern Python 3.
00:16.12 But on top of that there's other ones like Cython,
00:18.94 which lets you write type annotated python code that compiles to see and then runs near
00:24.46 the speed of C. There's a 'pypy'which is a jit compiled
00:30.28 version of C python. There's Jython which runs python on top of the JVM
00:35.55  There's 'ironPython' which runs Python on top of the '.NetCLR'
00:39.31 And there's other interoperability things as well.
00:42.69 But PyCharm supports all of these different interpreters and probably some others that I'm not
00:48.98 even think to list here as well.
00:50.54 But when you work with these different environments, PyCharm does know about them and helps you with them.
