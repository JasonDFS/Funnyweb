00:0.0 As we start to explore these features around PyCharm.
00:2.57 You need to think about the building blocks.
00:4.94 It turns out that PyCharm is actually more than just a Python IDE.
00:9.18  I've had people talk to me and say you know what I've
00:12.42 heard. PyCharm is awesome and I should totally be using it.
00:15.12 But you know what I have to do Javascript and Typescript as well.
00:18.73 And I also build an electron JS app so I'm not going to use that.
00:22.02 I'm gonna use something else that understands the javascript really well.
00:25.54 Well you know what? It's because the name is a little bit confusing.
00:28.88 Well why were these PyCharm on those types of things?
00:32.14 It turns out if you look at all the different JetBrains
00:34.66 IDE's PyCharm, AppCode, CLion, IntelliJ.
00:38.88 All these things are actually built upon the IntelliJ platform.
00:42.69 Now the J originally comes from Java.
00:44.71 Yes but it's been built to be extensible and work as a IDE.
00:48.69 For basically any language or any environment.
00:52.04 So we've got PyCharm for Python.
00:54.43 We've got WebStorm for things like Typescript and Javascript.
00:57.82 We've got AppCode for Swift and Objective C.
01:1.14 And so on because PyCharm is built on intelliJ.
01:4.07  Basically all any feature that shows up in intelliJ will be also a Py Charm feature.
01:8.86 I mentioned WebStorm. This is Jetbrains IDE's
01:12.84 for working on all the web things mostly front end Javascript, Typescript, CSS, LESS
01:20.09 'electron Js', Vue.Js all that kind of stuff.
01:23.65 And there's another one called DataGrip which is all about working with databases and working
01:29.32 with the SQL, create scripts,
01:31.78 queries, all the select consoles,
01:34.77 all the query consoles and whatnot.
01:37.04 So those are separate IDE's that you can go get.
01:39.73 But in the professional version of PyCharm,
01:42.12 it actually has Web Storm embedded in it effectively and it has data grip embedded in
01:47.12 it. So all of the cool javascript stuff that you can do with the Web
01:50.01 Storm. Well guess what you can do basically all of that with PyCharm,
01:53.2 All the cool database stuff. You can do a DataGrip,
01:56.04 you can do that with PyCharm as well.
01:58.44 So back to that person I spoke to they said well I would use something like
02:1.23 Web Storm because I really got to use proper Javascript stuff and I can't use PyCharm
02:5.96  or maybe I would use VS code.
02:7.54  because it understands Typescript,
02:9.84 So does PyCharm. And the reason why is PyCharm.
02:12.47 Professional basically has all these other pieces integrated into it or is built from it. However you wanna think about that.
