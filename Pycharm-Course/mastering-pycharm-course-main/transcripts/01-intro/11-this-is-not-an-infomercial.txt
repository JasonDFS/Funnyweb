00:17.14 I want to help everyone out there who would like to use it as well,
00:20.5 be as successful as they possibly can. As you go through the course,
00:24.68 I'm going to give you my honest opinion about the things that are valuable and who
00:29.09 knows, I'm sure I will complain about a thing or two as well along the
00:32.0 way, but generally just a big fan of PyCharm.
