00:11.44 Use the debugger to understand the flow of these co routines and these generators and
00:16.35 then even alter the flow with the
00:18.07 debugger by doing things like setting values that would otherwise not naturally occur.
00:22.96 So just follow along the your turn steps here and enjoy.
