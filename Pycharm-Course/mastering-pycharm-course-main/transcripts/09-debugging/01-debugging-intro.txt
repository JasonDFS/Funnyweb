00:2.84 Welcome to the debugging chapter, something I really really like about PyCharm is its
00:8.84 visual debugging tools ability to hit a breakpoint,
00:12.96 quickly set a breakpoint, hit that breakpoint,
00:15.32 see all the values of the code variables,
00:19.9 not just in your watch window,
00:21.36 but actually injected into your editor as well.
00:24.63 See And that's really cool over laid mode and it makes it just so much easier
00:29.44 to see what's going on. You can step through your code,
00:32.36 you can step through libraries that are libraries you imported or installed through pip.
00:37.94 And I do believe that this type of debugging is one of the places the other
00:41.36 editor options badly fall down. People end up doing a lot of print statements or
00:46.95 they end up in some kind of command line debugger and you're typing through.
00:51.19 Okay, now show me the line you're on.
00:52.83 Now, Step into the next line,
00:54.39 you've got to keep typing and it's just so super inefficient compared to being able to
00:58.91 visually see the code with the values and the locations over laid on it.
01:3.74 So really excited to dive into these tools with you,
01:6.73 we're going to take an application that has a couple of bugs in it,
01:9.78 it's not entirely obvious why or what's going on.
01:12.58 We're going to explore it and solve those bugs or fix those bugs with the debugging tools in PyCharm.
