00:0.04 Hey all I had a great presentation diving into all of the data science features of
00:5.19 PyCharm. When a week or two ago the folks over at JetBrains announced an
00:10.06 entirely new way to do data science over in a new IDE.
00:14.1  As well as bringing those features back in the PyCharm.
00:18.54 What does that mean for this course?
00:19.88 That means hold tight. I'm going to do a proper data science chapter for 
00:24.62 PyCharm which will include many of the features of data spell just like it does of
00:28.44 Data Grip. But I want to wait until this is out an EAP at
00:33.15 least right now it's in a private early access.
00:35.91 You can click here and sign up and then go be part of it.
00:38.96 But it'll take awhile until you actually can just download it without an invite.
00:42.84 So what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this chapter on hold instead of recording
00:46.89 the old style for you that's being replaced.
00:49.34 I'm gonna wait a couple of weeks and they're gonna replace it.
00:51.89 I'm gonna work with the folks at Jetbrains and replace it with this thing called data
00:55.61 spell and those features that we're also going to be added into PyCharm with that said
00:59.57 let's just take a quick look at this.
01:1.28 You can see Jetbrains dot com/data spell.
01:4.44 So it's tuned for the interactive style of working less software development.
01:9.33 More exploratory Jupyter notebook styles, local and remote environments.
01:13.96 It tends to work with 'conda'.
01:15.98 The anaconda style data science python distribution rather than pip and the built in python, also
01:23.42 as a lightweight workspace so you come over here you can see that here is a
01:26.96 Jupyter notebook inside of data spell and it has these cells but it also has all
01:32.59 the cool features of PyCharm and data spell.
01:35.38 But you can imagine it's using those features in a very very similar way.
01:39.44 A lot of cool stuff going on.
01:41.07 The things that I think will be interesting for you to hold on to for just
01:44.55 a minute are the PyCharm bits so you know just highlight those.
01:48.24 When will the new functionality make it into PyCharm professional?
01:51.03 As soon as JetBrains data spell is officially released although there is no specific date.
01:56.94 Why introduce a new IDE
01:58.73 In addition to PyCharm they expect data spell to be a more practical efficient environment
02:4.37 for working with data and it's really optimized for showing you things like tables that come
02:8.96 out of Pandas, data frames and so on,
02:10.94 which should you choose data spell or PyCharm professional they say at least here this
02:15.33 is up to you if you're involved in both Data science and development choose PyCharm
02:19.34 If you're just doing data science maybe data spell.
02:23.94 When will the data science functionality be available in Pycharm Community edition.
02:27.74 Never just like the current data science features that the paid feature.
02:32.74 Well JetBrains status spell bundle, web development nope,
02:35.72 that's PyCharm professional. The most important takeaway from all of this right here is
02:40.58 when will the new functionality make it into PyCharm Professional?
02:45.04 Not so much win, but will.
02:46.8 Yes, it will. All of it will just like data grip,
02:49.94 just like Web storm and so on.
02:51.94 So hang tight. This should be out in a way that I can record it
02:55.63 and put it together. I'm gonna work with the Jetbrains folks,
02:57.74 get you something concrete for now and then go and sign up for the private EAP
03:2.58 So that you can get it early and get your hands on it and
03:6.17 play around with it. And then if you have PyCharm professional,
03:8.43 it's just going to roll into that in the future as well.
