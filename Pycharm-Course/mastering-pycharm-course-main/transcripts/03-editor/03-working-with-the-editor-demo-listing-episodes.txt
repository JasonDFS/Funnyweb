00:0.14 We've come a long way with our app and we've seen some really cool features but
00:4.54 boy bar there more to go.
00:5.9 Let's keep it exploring. So over here let's come back to the top here I
00:10.13 realized I haven't called print header yet and then we're going to download some things.
00:14.01 So let's see here's our podcast downloader and there's the episode being printed out but we
00:19.96 don't really need to do that do we?
00:23.84 What we'd like to do is we would like to show the details.
00:27.24 So let's go over and say show titles or something like that.
00:31.24 Now PyCharm just like it would add download info to service.
00:35.24 It's going to do the same but for locally so come down here and say show
00:38.92 titles now this totally works. But remember my philosophy I like this high level main
00:43.52 function at the top so I'm gonna put this below down here.
00:48.44 All right so now we want to show the titles now that we've downloaded some items
00:52.37 that's going to mean some more functions for our service.
00:55.34 Let's start by getting the lowest and the highest episode number.
00:59.07 So we'll say I'll call this start it's going to be something will say 
01:4.31 service.get_min_episode_id.
01:8.61 Something like that. And then again 'cmd+d' because I'm going to write something so similar
01:14.44 and max these don't exist until we hit.
01:19.64 'Alt+enter' and then they do and because we store this in a dictionary and the
01:25.72 dictionary has the ID's
01:27.28 right there as the episode ID's.
01:29.18 all we have to do is say we're going to return in this
01:32.09 case the min of episodes dot check out all the dictionary.
01:36.95 Auto complete. Fantastic what we want are the keys and same thing I want to
01:41.5 have basically the same functions to highlight this 'cmd+d'.
01:44.56 Changed the min's to max and we'll be all golden.
01:48.14 Be a little reformatting. Perfect.
01:52.44 But these are looking good and then we just want to loop over these items so
01:58.03 we'll say we're gonna start at the beginning range from start and this is a non
02:4.22 inclusive end. So I'm gonna do a plus one right there and that will give
02:8.36 us all the numbers from start to end.
02:10.57 My integers inclusive. And then I'll just get the episode we'll go to our service
02:15.88 and right one final function. Get details.
02:19.55  Passing the episode id
02:20.81  It doesn't exist it takes a parameter we alt to enter it now we
02:26.53 have a function. Get  details with a guest at the parameter name.
02:30.48 That seems decent. And here we can just return episodes.
02:35.84 Get now we could it's a dictionary.
02:37.6 We could try it like this style episode I'd but if it's not there it's going
02:41.79 to crash and I'd rather return none and just say you know I got no details
02:45.76 so we're gonna do a get(episode_id) and I think we're about good to go
02:50.64 So let's just print out a couple of things.
02:53.07 We're going to print out a cool little f string and let me show you something
02:55.74 amazing about f strings and PyCharm.
02:59.14 Remember f strings? We go like this,
03:0.57 we put an F at the beginning and we say something and then we can go
03:4.37 right, let's see and we can put like the end or some variable in
03:8.46 here. So that's standard. But what's amazing is so often I'll get to this
03:14.5 part and realize, oh this should have been an F string back,
03:16.99 back, back, back back F forward,
03:18.5 forward forward. It's quite annoying.
03:20.84 So here's the cool thing come over here.
03:23.89 I'm going to say I would like to print out something to do with variable or
03:28.76 whatever. So we'll put a number and then we'll put the id out there and
03:32.39 let's try that type parentheses,
03:34.92 nothing's happening. But if I start to type it will auto complete.
03:38.19 If I don't pick anything, it'll just keep going as a regular string.
03:41.31 But if I pick out of this list,
03:43.64 it automatically makes it an F string.
03:45.34 Beautiful. What I want is id.
03:47.38  Now there's another thing that's not super fun notice there's no help here,
03:52.34 there's no information about what this is.
03:54.84 We'll fix that in a moment.
03:55.89 Okay, so this is going to be,
03:58.54 I think I'll say 'episode.title'.
04:1.14 Clean things up. We call on the show titles we are.
04:5.48 I think this might work. Let's give it a run.
04:8.04 Oh fantastic. Look at that.
04:11.14 How cool is that? We got it totally working.
04:13.84 There's all the great episodes we've done over the past five years incredible.
04:17.7 HDMX
04:18.75 And Data science and Docker. But here's the episode id we parsed out here is
04:24.85 the here's the actual title. Maybe make a little more obvious by putting it like
04:31.04 uh this something like that. Fantastic little app,
04:38.54 cool features. We've got our F strings,
04:40.97 we've got creating this local function,
04:44.24 all kinds of good stuff. We're able to do with this part of our editor demo
