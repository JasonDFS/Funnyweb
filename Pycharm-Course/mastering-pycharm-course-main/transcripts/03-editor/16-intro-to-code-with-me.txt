00:0.04 The final editor feature we want to talk about.
00:2.85 It's kind of like google docs but for PyCharm and it's fantastic.
00:6.59 It's relatively new and it's called 'Code with me'.
00:9.74 The idea is over in your project.
00:11.81 There's a little people icon appear at the top,
00:14.12 but if you click it, it'll say enable access and copy an invitation link.
00:18.68 And what that's going to do is it will give you a link that you can
00:21.24 share, can pick how much access you want to give,
00:24.49 let them edit the files, let them run the debugger,
00:27.13 interact with the terminal and so on.
00:29.0 Even start a voice call and you can share this with somebody and just like google
00:33.21 docs, you can both look at it and type on it and keep it in
00:35.99 sync. And what's amazing is they're not going to get your source code downloaded,
00:39.43 they're connected and running it locally.
00:41.49 So if they open up a terminal in their PyCharm,
00:44.14 it's going to be a terminal on your machine with access to your infrastructure and the
00:47.95 stuff that it needs on your machine to run.
00:50.21 Right? So if it needs like a data base set up,
00:52.84 we'll be able to interact with the code that talks to the database because it's just
00:56.75 your current setup. Once you send that off,
00:59.99 it's gonna say so and so wants to join.
01:2.45 Do you want to let them know this is like a final chance to not let
01:5.28 them code with me bomb. My guess is the way you would phrase it,
01:8.34 the code with the equivalent of a zoom bombing.
01:10.71 They can't just drop in if they have the code,
01:12.57 they've also got to be let in.
01:14.74 And then once you say okay,
01:16.1 they were joined, you can actually click up here on their name and follow along
01:19.6 Then you'll see actually a little window,
01:23.39 you'll see their cursor, you know,
01:24.95 be able to actually go from file to file to file as they're interacting with it
01:28.93 and see their changes. All of this stuff is amazing.
01:31.34 It's much better seen in action.
01:33.59 So in the next section we're gonna go and run through this with a co host
01:38.16 of python bytes, Brian Okken.
01:39.71 he and I are gonna fix a quick problem with that podcast app we built at the beginning.
