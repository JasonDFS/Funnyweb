00:0.14 So we're here in this podcast program and it's not working.
00:3.53 If I try to run it,
00:5.24 you can see that it has this little header that comes out and says zero episodes
00:10.34 and yet if we go to pythonbytes.fm over to the episodes.
00:15.46 There are clearly many, many episodes here so something's wrong.
00:19.92 I've been on this all day,
00:21.35 I can't fix it, I need help.
00:22.74 So let's go over to code with me here and right now there's no session but
00:27.14 I'll enable and copy the link.
00:29.94 You have a choice about the permissions you can do this is read only and just
00:33.47 let somebody look but not touch or interact with certain files over.
00:38.0 I can also changes so they can edit files but they can't do things like run
00:41.62 code. They can't open up the terminal and run arbitrary commands but hey this is
00:45.67 Brian Okken I trust him
00:46.85 Right Brian wouldn't do anything wrong so I'm going to pull this up and just give
00:50.03 them full control so he can debug and step through and so on.
00:52.4 We could also start an automatic voice call.
00:54.74 The recording for this setup doesn't work that well.
00:56.97 So we're going to use a different mechanism and not use the voice call here.
01:0.74 Alright link has been copied, I'm going to send this to Brian and he'll be
01:3.51 here in a moment. So when Brian got that link,
01:7.09 I sent to him over a chat.
01:8.31 He clicked it and it opens up and says PyCharm is opening is downloading a
01:12.68 version that he needs the first time you do this often.
01:15.63 It's going to actually download a small lightweight copy of PyCharm to run.
01:19.57 He's already done it before. So it opened really quick.
01:21.71 There's a code, we check that I accept it.
01:24.14 It must match who else would be joining this thing right now.
01:26.81 So Okkin has joined. Right.
01:29.64 Hey. Yeah. So hey,
01:31.26 thanks for joining me today. Have a bit of problem.
01:33.75 You know, I told you about that cool thing that would tell you the titles
01:36.59 of all of our episodes on python bytes that we do together.
01:39.44 Yeah, yeah, that would be awesome.
01:41.73 It's not, it comes back here and it says uh when I run it,
01:44.5 it's zero episodes. So um,
01:47.38 I'm just gonna follow you around.
01:48.95 Um, I'm going to click on you and that will follow you.
01:50.84 Can you go over to the service thing where we're trying to download them.
01:53.9 I'm not very good with Xml and X path and there's something busted here.
01:57.31 Help me out like, So you can see online 18 that I'm doing this x
02:1.64 path query against the XML dom the element tree
02:5.74 right? Yeah, you can see this is,
02:7.35 this is brian's highlighted brian's little cursor and highlighting like think google docs.
02:12.03 Right? So there's something wrong with that X path query because it's clearly coming back
02:15.97 when you look like you're actually going and just run it,
02:17.92 hit the play button for me on your side.
02:20.14 Okay, that's a great point or just play just run it just place.
02:23.58 Okay. Yeah you can see it's working with a total of zero episodes.
02:28.54 Yeah that's not right. No that's not right.
02:30.77 So there's something wrong with the X Path query.
02:32.46 Why don't you try just printing out items and see what we get are actually printing
02:35.56 out the dom just right to print the dom and see what we get printed.
02:38.35 Um Okay so yeah let's run it now.
02:46.04 Oh actually that's not super helpful is it?
02:47.96 Let's go I'm gonna try printing out the strings.
02:50.54 I'm gonna change that for a moment here and running again.
02:53.01 That's still the same thing. What do you think about the debugger?
02:55.34 I'll put a breakpoint here and we can plug into that and see if we can
02:58.11 see more about that. Oh cool.
03:1.14 Yeah you go to the dom yeah we can go to the thanks.
03:4.49 Well there's not a whole lot going on.
03:6.09 I guess we can response text.
03:9.03 We look at the response text.
03:10.31 Okay. Clearly there's Xml in this response text here right,
03:13.64 in this so there's something going on and you got any idea because I
03:19.36 thought I had it right, I thought it was channel/items.
03:22.04 Well is that is that in point correct?
03:24.24 Yeah like rss it was channeled and it has a bunch of items so oh maybe
03:29.27 there it's just called item do you think?
03:32.04 Yeah yeah let's try that. Okay.
03:35.48 All right. All right again.
03:37.14 Oh yes that was some oh no the numbers are on.
03:41.64 What do you mean they're wrong?
03:43.44 Well like here at the bottom we have fuzzy,
03:45.56 wuzzy, Lousy Fuzzy I love that title.
03:49.31 Um but it says 236 but it's lined up with 235.
03:54.24 Oh okay that's that's not ideal.
03:56.32 Let's see. Um So I think the code right on the same screen that you're
04:0.07 looking for like online 21 here this is where we come up and if you look
04:4.24 actually this episode it goes title link,
04:7.64 pub date show ID and that's what's getting displayed there.
04:10.94 Is that show ID? Okay that's what do you think that should we not have
04:16.28 that minus you think maybe maybe that might be.
04:19.19 What's the problem? You drop it,
04:22.27 take it away. Okay. Why are you running again?
04:24.67 See what happens. Oh there we go.
04:28.44 You're a genius. We have our elements and we have our titles and we have
04:31.86 the numbers fix brilliant. And I just want to point out to everyone watching that
04:36.44 when Brian ran it it didn't download the code to his machine and run it.
04:40.13 It ran on my machine. So for example if we were talking to a database
04:43.84 or some infrastructure that only my computer had access to like he would be controlling,
04:48.75 interacted with that even though in his PyCharm.
04:50.63 He's debugging and looking at the variables and editing and so on.
04:54.24 I think we should check this in.
04:55.44 This is awesome. So let me go over here to the commit section.
04:59.14 And one thing that I found really interesting is there are changes,
05:3.24 there are changes for me and you can see like I change this channel/items
05:8.72 to item and there's also changes by Okken.
05:11.38 So it actually in the get check in it separates the changes.
05:15.26 It shows like that subtraction of one that you did.
05:17.98 So nice. Uh huh. We'll admit all these changes first.
05:25.44 I'll commit these and this just has changed by Brian.
05:31.09 Cool. Well it looks like we've got it all fixed.
05:34.04 Thanks so much for being here.
05:34.83 I'm gonna kick you out of the session.
05:36.34 All right. So yeah. Bye.
