00:0.04 While I encourage you to write your code in multiple small files,
00:3.68 not one huge one, We're still going to end up with somewhat large files.
00:7.95 Right? And if you have little warnings or errors or maybe just want to look
00:13.14 and see what's down near different section.
00:15.8 But especially if there's a little warnings or colors in the scroll bar,
00:19.48 you might want to just look down there and see what's going on without actually changing
00:24.12 locations. So here we are in a somewhat large file,
00:27.25 you see the line numbers 1 to 29 and then all of a sudden it goes
00:31.38 to 114. Actually, if we put our cursor right there,
00:35.63 if we hover over where the scroll bar would be and wait for a moment,
00:39.53 PyCharm will pop up this view of what would it be like if we actually scroll
00:43.51 to that location. So down there,
00:45.02 apparently online 114 115 we can see there's a function called announced that takes an
00:50.85 item in a message. And as you move up and down your mouse,
00:55.05 you actually move the lens mode around.
00:56.78 You're trying to figure out what's going on in a file and you don't necessarily want
01:0.71 to leave where you are. But you want to look a little bit around lens mode.
