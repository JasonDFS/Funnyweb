00:0.04 One thing that's really important when you're working with code is to know how it's being
00:3.82 used, especially if you're going to make changes to it.
00:6.94 If you're going to add new features or you're considering removing it,
00:9.71 you think maybe maybe no one's using it?
00:12.24 Are you sure? So one really neat feature we can do on many symbols,
00:16.86 on variables, on functions on classes and so on as we can right click and
00:20.88 say find usages. If we hit that,
00:23.89 it will actually show us the code all the places in our code where that's being
00:27.92 used. So for example, here is the definition of get details and down here
00:32.26 in program share titles in that function or calling this line episode =service.get_details
00:38.81  and that's where it's being used.
00:40.95 Obviously in our simple little example here,
00:42.94 we only have one place where it's being used.
00:45.5 But in a real app, you probably have many places that you could jump around
00:48.93 and find where the codes being used.
00:50.72 So make sure that you use this to understand how the code being used across the entire project.
