00:0.14 We saw that we can use 'cmd+shift+A' or on the other platforms.
00:3.64 'Ctrl+shift+A' to pull up our find action and run it.
00:7.94 And we also saw that in there,
00:9.52 we have these really cool little highlights that show us what the hotkey's are.
00:13.2 For example, the re factor this,
00:14.85 you can see that's 'ctrl+T' with my current  binding.
00:18.44 So a couple of things like can I control that key binding,
00:21.65 Can I add custom keyboard shortcuts that may be map these ones that don't have them like
00:27.66 Project View pop up pre factoring group apparently has no hotkey or anything like that
00:32.36 Many of these don't notice some of these settings here are going to be based
00:36.8 on your key mapping, which you can actually find the cheat sheet at 
00:40.3 'bit.ly/pycharm-card'.
00:42.34 There's a pdf, you can check out or you can open up the preferences and
00:46.88 go over to key map and then there's a couple of things to pick here.
00:49.34 You can have Mac OS, Emacs,
00:52.84 you can have Sublime, you have Idea,
00:55.55 Classic and so on. And if you're on Windows,
00:57.83 I suspect you would have a Windows option here as well.
01:1.09 So these are the ones that we have on this system and if you want to
01:4.7 change them, you just go down like for example,
01:6.96 it says type info, it says control shift P.
01:9.62 If you want to change that,
01:10.46 you can go and add a hotkey that will actually modify that,
01:13.58 you can export these and import them and all of those things?
01:18.04 Well, if you're may be a Vim user,
01:19.96 you might be looking at this list and thinking,
01:21.64 well why does the max get all the magic?
01:23.78 And I don't. That's weird.
01:25.35 Right. Well we can go over to the plug-ins and get a bunch of
01:30.75 different E maps, a bunch of different hot keys and key setups.
01:35.22 So if you go to plug ins it's not immediately obvious how to do this.
01:38.57 But you can type key map in the search and then you get a 
01:42.18 VSCode. Key map,
01:43.16 you get a visual studio key map.
01:44.99 So things like F5 would be the bugging and control of five would just run
01:48.59 it. I'm guessing something like that,
01:50.34 you've got Vim, you've got net beans,
01:53.75 you've got X code. So there's a whole bunch of look how big that scroll
01:56.79 bar is. So if you don't like the one that's there.
01:59.94 Well, guess what? Just go over here,
02:1.43 search for Key map and install it as a plug in update for your editor.
