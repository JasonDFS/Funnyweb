00:0.04 You want to get the back story and learn more about the history and the internals
00:4.06 of PyCharm? Well, I interviewed Dmitry Trofimov Way,
00:8.63 way back in 2015. He's one of the lead developers on PyCharm.
00:14.11 And we had about an hour long conversation about where PyCharm came from how
00:19.3 they're thinking about features and all kinds of stuff.
00:21.47 So if you want a little bit of an extra story and you want to just
00:24.12 listen to something for an hour,
00:25.51 grab talk python episode 36 but I'm playing the background and you get a little bit
00:31.54 of the back story, the inside view as well.
