00:0.0 Do you remember how you felt when you looked at the screen at the beginning of this course
00:3.11 It probably felt overwhelming. Maybe it doesn't feel that way so much anymore.
00:8.19 You probably go, yeah, there's the project and I'll look that to do things
00:10.43 That was cool. And here's the database stuff and so on.
00:13.17 But there are still a lot of features that I'm sure I'm going to take some
00:17.1 practice and some reinforcement to make part of your daily work.
00:22.93 Recall, I give you a plan on how to do that.
00:24.71 Here is a good time to put that plan into action. Starts with discovery.
00:29.74 Congratulations. You made it to the end of the course.
00:31.84 We've covered so many things and you have definitely discovered them along the way.
00:35.17 So check that one off next is to recall it and the third is to practice
00:40.46 it. But I give you three ideas on what you might do here.
00:44.74 One is go and get the cheat sheet.
00:46.79 Remember it's linked right on the homepage.
00:49.41 Read me of the GitHub repository.
00:51.44 They'll get that and keep it handy.
00:52.84 That'll help you know, some of the things you can do and maybe emphasize which
00:57.07 ones you want to work on install presentation assistant that will show you as you interact
01:2.25 with different parts of the app that oh look,
01:4.41 here's the hockey or here's an easier way to use that feature and finally sticky notes
01:9.91 or a note pad full of notes or even some kind of to do list,
01:13.77 write down the things that you're like,
01:15.33 this is really important. I haven't been using this.
01:17.63 But if I did, it would make a huge difference for me,
01:19.76 write those down, make sure you're focusing on one of them for a day or
01:24.7 for a week, something like that.
01:26.46 Once you get that feature and that blow really down,
01:29.79 you know, check it off,
01:30.91 throw away the sticky note, pull up the next one to go,
01:33.08 All right, I'm gonna try to make a concerted effort of using this feature this
01:36.94 week or this day, whatever timeframe you're working on those three things,
01:41.08 I think you'll be able to make these ideas from this course,
01:43.34 stick and get even more value out of it.
