00:0.0 You've seen me play with the tests.
00:1.47 It is your turn. It is time to set up some pytest,
00:5.22 write some tests, then use code coverage to see if you've tested everything and
00:9.73 maybe even write a few more tests after that,
00:12.54 we're gonna start with some existing code very similar to what I did go into the
00:16.58 your table section here. Did this all set up?
00:19.93 write some tests test it with pytest. Have a good time.
