00:2.94 Unit testing and having tests for your software in general is one of the key indicators
00:7.86 of professional software and it really separates the amateur beginner hobby types of projects from things
00:15.47 that are meant to be long lasting and have to work because your service up time
00:20.23 depends on it or people aren't paying money for it.
00:24.24 And PyCharm has deep support for unit testing and other types of testing across all
00:30.54 the major frameworks in python. PyTest knows the built in unit tests and more
00:35.81 You also see that it has great integration with related technologies such as code coverage
00:42.22 So if I want to run some tests and I want to know how well
00:46.34 are these tests, testing my code,
00:48.26 one of the things you need to know as well,
00:50.2 what part of your code is it even running and could coverage tells you that And
00:53.63 the visualizations and integration of code coverage with unit tests and PyCharm is absolutely second
00:59.45 to none. It's amazing. It even has support for running tests every time that
01:3.83 you save a change to a file.
01:5.42 So once you have your tests in place you can check a little button and as
01:8.85 you edit your code, it just has a little light green or red.
01:12.84 Are the test currently passing? Are they currently failing continuously throughout your day as you
01:18.01 work? So there's a lot of cool things to explore in testing the PyCharm and we get them in this chapter.
