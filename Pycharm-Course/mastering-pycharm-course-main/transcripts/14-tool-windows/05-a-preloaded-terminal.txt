00:0.14 When you're doing programming, you absolutely have to work on the command line or the
00:4.0 terminal. So let's suppose I want to do something with the course.
00:7.58 So I've got to come over here and go to my desktop and go into the
00:10.58 course and because I'm running a super cool shell.
00:14.52 'Oh-My-Zshell', which I definitely recommend that you check this out.
00:17.85 If you're on a project system,
00:20.14 check that out. We get all sorts of cool stuff like highlighting the fact that
00:24.44 we're in a Git repo and then we're on branch ref for the moment.
00:28.54 But if I want to work with python stuff with this project,
00:31.46 I need to make sure we activate this and now maybe I'm in the right location
00:38.68 I got the right python activated and so on that was a few steps we
00:45.2 can avoid those steps incredibly easy with one of the PyCharm Windows down here terminal
00:49.86 So we go down here,
00:51.89 we automatically end up in the same location which is the top level of our project
00:56.1 We get the virtual environment activated.
00:59.38 Let's see which python three. It's the exact one we want out of that virtual
01:5.35 environment. We 'pip' list, we see all the things that are listed there and
01:10.32 we even have our recent history just like you would have throughout your entire operating system
01:14.52 So what were the last couple of pip commands,
01:17.03 I ran pip list pip installed. Trust me pip install 'colorama'.
01:21.74 What if we wanted to do an upgrade.
01:23.72 Oh yeah, this is the kind of warning.
01:25.7 We could fix that warning by running this and this is the full shell.
01:29.46 Like you can ssh or you can tell that or you can do all kinds of
01:33.51 things, basically anything you need to do in the terminal,
01:35.66 or almost anything you need to do.
01:37.77 You can do down here. So this is a really good way to do anything
01:41.54 on the command line or terminal that happens to do with our code or project,
01:46.69 the python environment, the packages and so on.
