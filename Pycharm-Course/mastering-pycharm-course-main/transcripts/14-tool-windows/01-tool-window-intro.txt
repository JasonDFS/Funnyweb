00:2.74 Are you ready for a grab bag?
00:5.34 We're going to talk about an assorted bunch of tools.
00:8.54 These are super important and really helpful.
00:11.84 We probably touched on them before as we've interacted with different parts of PyCharm,
00:16.49 but they didn't really fit into the topics we've covered so far.
00:19.85 And so we didn't dive deep or call them out in particular and some I'm sure
00:23.77 you've not seen yet, at least not in this course.
00:27.34 So we're going to dive into all those little extra windows and other things and tabs
00:32.18 and maybe even open a menu or two.
00:34.37 We'll see and pull out some of these extra tools that are not obvious, but really really helpful.
