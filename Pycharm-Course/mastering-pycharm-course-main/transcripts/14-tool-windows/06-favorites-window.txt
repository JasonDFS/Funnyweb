00:0.14 We've seen a bunch of ways to navigate around,
00:2.84 I go into definition, doing the search anywhere,
00:5.41 all those kinds of things. But let me show you another way to find areas
00:9.26 you may have marked as interesting.
00:11.74 So let's go down here and say I'm interested in things to do with downloading stuff
00:16.48 So maybe this service file that we're going to download some things here.
00:21.04 I can go over here, click on add to favorites.
00:24.29 And let's just say call this network.
00:27.74 Okay, so where else might be calling?
00:30.59 Get requests, requests, not good.
00:35.04 This is one over here in the performance.
00:37.24 So maybe this one we also want to add to our network.
00:42.24 Look again, this one also relevant.
00:48.55 Okay, so we've added three things to our favorites.
00:50.71 Where does that go down here?
00:53.44 So this favorites window actually brings together a handful of things that you might have already
00:58.24 done, suppose. And here you've already got like a break point here and a
01:2.91 breakpoint there and then a break point.
01:5.64 Of course you can find those while you're debugging.
01:7.79 But what if you just want to say oh yeah,
01:10.07 I wanted to see that part where I had a break point.
01:12.33 Well down here we've got things like the favorites,
01:14.87 we just added. These are the files were interested in.
01:17.44 These are the breakpoints we had we can also create what are called bookmarks.
01:21.94 Let's go back here. There.
01:24.48 We are kind of like a break point,
01:26.8 we want to have a place right here to remember but it has really nothing to
01:30.25 do with the debugging. So we can kind of an  right click and add
01:33.49 a bookmark at a bookmark down here.
01:40.84 A pneumonic bookmark. Yes, but we can get back to,
01:45.94 Yeah. All right. If we expand this out,
01:48.91 you can see we've got a little Pneumonic bookmark and these we can jump around.
01:52.94 So this is sort of a catch all for either files or locations and files that
01:58.11 I want to remember to get back to you.
01:59.51 Maybe I've got a new project.
02:1.11 I'm working on a feature and I'm like,
02:2.61 there's a ton of files here,
02:3.8 but these are the three locations.
02:5.25 I really need to just jump to using the whole thing up there.
02:9.08 You might use one of these sections down here at the bottom.
