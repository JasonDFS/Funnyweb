00:0.14 You've seen me do all sorts of cool stuff with PyCharm in databases now,
00:3.74 it's your turn. So be sure to do the hands on exercises for this chapter
00:7.97 there over here under chapter five.
00:10.85 Basically what we're gonna do is we're going to open an existing SQLite database and 
00:15.12 PyCharm. There's really two things that are meant to happen there one just to make
00:18.55 sure you can open a SQLite database and you know how to do that.
00:21.64 But to and maybe more important is to make sure that your system is set up
00:25.7 with the right drivers so that all the tools automatically can work with it from their
00:30.22 arm. Then you're going to write some queries against some existing data.
00:34.4 You're going to use the diagrams to view the tables and so on.
00:37.85 So basically you're going to play with one of those SQLite databases that we've already created
00:42.77 and get some hands on seeing how the database tools work for yourself. Allright have fun.
