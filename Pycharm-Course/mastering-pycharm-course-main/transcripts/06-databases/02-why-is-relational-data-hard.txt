00:0.04 I hear a lot of people say that working with relational databases is hard and to
00:4.27 a degree I agree with them.
00:6.25 It is challenging and you have to be very precise making changes you know sometimes trying
00:12.41 to make a change will conflict with existing data and so on.
00:16.34 I also think that there's another thing at work here.
00:19.94 I think a lot of people are working with either broken or sub optimal database tools
00:24.6 If you don't have some kind of nice visualization way to work with your database
00:29.53 you're kind of doing it wrong.
00:32.14 If you don't have something that will allow you to write queries against your database that
00:36.74 understands the schema and gives you auto complete and checking for the SQL queries.
00:41.74 You right might not be doing it right.
00:44.64 I'm really excited to show you this stuff here around PyCharm because it's going to
00:49.32 fix a lot of these sub optimal or broken tool problems that and well migrations and
00:56.77 the object relational impedance mismatch. So those things are just inherent to relational databases and
01:1.84 that's how it goes. But this broken tool problem,
01:4.69 we're going to fix that in this chapter.
01:6.35 Remember this pyramid of how PyCharm is built.
01:10.34 There's this data grip section right here and almost all the features that we're going to
01:14.69 talk about in this chapter come from DataGrip.
01:17.52 So this is not just PyCharm,
01:18.73 having some understanding of working with relational databases but it's basically encapsulating an entire.
01:25.28 IDE specifically built for working with relational databases. Let's dive in.
