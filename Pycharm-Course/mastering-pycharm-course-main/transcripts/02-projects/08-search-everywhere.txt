00:0.04 Let's look at another super powerful feature called 'Search Anywhere'.
00:4.94 And if you open up PyCharm and there's just this empty placeholder where the documents go.
00:9.83 go. The very first thing that you see is search everywhere.
00:13.12 Double up arrow the double shift.
00:15.6 What does that mean? Well there's this search icon over here and you could click
00:19.88 this. It says it searches for classes,
00:21.78 files to windows, et cetera.
00:23.41 Even more than that. But I never use this.
00:26.42 I just press shift really quickly got to do it pretty quick.
00:30.64 So hit shift a couple times and check this out.
00:34.24 First thing you get if you don't type anything if you don't have anything selected is
00:38.12 you get your recent files. So for example,
00:41.25 we had this UI helper open here.
00:43.56 This is the rock paper scissors game that up at the top is using the UI
00:48.41 helper that we just saw. So incredibly helpful.
00:51.68 And I use this all the time.
00:53.3 If you have a small project that just has one or two files,
00:55.88 well, just go to that file.
00:57.66 But real projects are large, much much larger.
01:1.75 For example, over at talk python training,
01:4.44 We've got about 20,000 lines of Python code that make up the website.
01:8.84 You don't want to just click around till you find it.
01:11.31 You want to be able to quickly jump there.
01:13.21 And one of the ways you can do that is to jump to the recent files
01:16.64 but maybe maybe we want to go and find something else over here.
01:21.36 This rock paper scissors things. One of the things that it does is that here
01:24.27 you can see right here is it shows the leaderboard.
01:26.81 So I suppose I don't have this open.
01:28.48 But I I know there's something about a leader or showing the leader board and I
01:32.19 want to get too. It's all pull up search anywhere and I'll just start to
01:35.21 type, I'll just type of leader.
01:37.24 Look there's all the functions that we could do.
01:39.19 We could load leaders, we could show the leader board and then obviously I could
01:42.7 jump back over to it. That's pretty cool.
01:45.54 But you gotta make sure unselected and pull it back up.
01:48.21 But there's better stuff I could do.
01:50.09 I could just type notice it was show_ leaderboard.
01:53.68 I could type sl and it just matches the casing the separating letters here.
01:59.64 It also works for camel casing,
02:0.97 like S, L,
02:3.24 The 'sl' here's the show leaderboard.
02:5.0 But notice there's a whole bunch of other things like settings about turning the line numbers
02:9.47 on and off and the local history and so on.
02:13.64 So we could restrict this. Just a classes.
02:15.75 And notice here, we're looking in all places,
02:17.94 we could just look in the project.
02:19.67 I don't think many classes here,
02:21.01 so not all that's gonna happen in the files and the symbols.
02:25.92 This is what we're working on.
02:27.07 And then the actions these are like commands.
02:29.49 These are the menu commands and whatnot.
02:31.14 Instead of if you don't remember what the hotkey is like.
02:34.66 Alt/option+ shift command d to show local changes as UML which whoever remembers that
02:41.84 you could just type UML.
02:44.94 No. Yeah, there it is.
02:45.82 And then it reminds you why you're there,
02:47.42 what the hotkey would be, but you don't have to use it,
02:49.85 right. This is super, super useful.
02:52.56 So two really important things to take away nothing selected.
02:56.05 And having done it before. Really important for jumping around recent files,
02:59.57 even if they're not open. And then the other one is,
03:2.14 let's go to that leaderboard. I want to jump down to the show leaderboard and
03:9.36 there it is now, it doesn't just take you over here.
03:12.38 There's one more thing to keep in mind.
03:13.7 So suppose I'm I've got this collapsed and I've got this selected and then I go
03:21.8 over here, let me actually close it.
03:23.94 Let's go on and back over here.
03:25.49 Now, I want to go to the show leaderboard.
03:29.34 I go back to it. Look,
03:31.4 it has it exactly as it was like,
03:33.61 this is collapsed. This is selected.
03:36.94 Really, really nice that it takes it back,
03:38.73 takes you back to it exactly as you were working with it before.
03:41.46 It doesn't just open it from scratch.
03:43.74 So this search anywhere is really,
03:46.29 really valuable and I'm certain it's in general under used.
03:50.33 I have nothing else certainly for the recent files but goes way beyond Finally,
03:54.82 you can also include non projects items.
03:56.8 So if I want to look for requests,
03:58.39 if I've got requests installed as a package here,
04:1.65 you can see that would jump me over to the actual code for the request package
04:7.54 This is the thing that we installed.
04:10.34 Search anywhere, make sure you make good use of it,
04:13.17 double shift or the little icon in the top right.
