00:0.14 As I'm sure you know the way you learn programming and tools like this is through
00:4.3 practice and experience not just watching,
00:7.34 even though that is a nice way to get exposure to the ideas.
00:10.34 So in this course I've created a whole section called your turn.
00:15.84 Now it is your turn for this chapter And since this is the first one,
00:19.29 I'm going to walk you through it a little more than normal.
00:22.04 So come on down here to the your turn section and then find the project that
00:25.93 we're working on right now. This is a section one of the first your turn
00:31.04 we come down here. It basically has a read me that you just fall along
00:34.14 Sometimes it might have a project that you start from or some other data that
00:38.24 it's going to say for you to pick up and use but this one,
00:40.57 it's just start from scratch. We're going to do two things in this.
00:44.37 Your turn, one is you're going to create a new project like we did and
00:48.62 then the other is to work with an existing project.
00:50.98 So to create a new project,
00:52.49 it will talk you through the steps and what to do and how to use the
00:56.56 PyCharm settings to create that new project with a virtual environment and so on and
01:1.1 then you get it running, get it going.
01:3.94 The next thing we'll do is start out with a complex project like we did previously
01:8.17 you just follow along through the steps here.
01:10.24 Not absolutely required, but I encourage you to do it because I do think if
01:13.55 you fall along through these your turns,
01:15.08 it will help the idea of stick and give you a chance to explore them right away.
