00:0.04 Remember that Flask could have Jinja or Mako and there's other frameworks like pyramid that
00:6.6 have Chameleon or even some extensions that I have written for,
00:10.47 say Fast API that allows you to use both Jinja and Chameleon with Flask API Those
00:16.34 are open source. If you care about them,
00:17.65 just check them out of my GitHub repo If I've got this dot html file,
00:22.12 remember straight away when I type something.
00:24.43 It it started doing all the cool stuff than it does for Jinja.
00:28.62 How does it know? How is it?
00:30.27 There's nothing about the extension here.
00:31.89 It's not like J2 or some odd things like that.
00:34.53 It's just html. How does it know which one of these we're going to use
00:38.44 if you created with Flask and you choose the option,
00:40.59 it sets that for the project but if you open an existing one,
00:44.34 it might not know if you want to change it,
00:47.24 how would it know? So let's go and open up the preferences real quick and
00:51.16 you come over here and type template languages to search for it.
00:54.57 Or you just go down to language.
00:55.76 Framework, template language and you can go down and add different file types and indicate
01:1.61 which ones those are being involved with for your templates and then here's what you do
01:5.66 Usually sometimes you'll find this set to be none and you'll get no auto complete
01:10.08 So if you get no auto complete in your html for the template side features
01:15.64 be a Chameleon or Jinja or whatever.
01:17.87 Go check this and and realize that you might have to set it.
01:21.43 So we go over here and click Jinja
01:24.58 it will now know, but if I go over here and click Chameleon notice it will
01:29.42 be getting different stuff. So if I do that book no more help.
01:32.78 But if I had a div and chameleon we have this thing called the template attribute
01:36.29 language. So I'd say tal notice there's all the chameleon auto complete.
01:40.54 Why? Because I told PyCharm my html files are chameleon,
01:45.74 they're not Jinja because this is Flask but it's really important that if this is not
01:50.14 set you will get a much lower end experience.
01:53.22 Also note that this is a feature,
01:56.22 one of the first features were encountering that is a PyCharm professional feature when you
02:2.25 use the community one does a lot of cool things but it doesn't do the server
02:5.76 side web frameworks, you can create and run flask and other apps but you don't
02:10.83 get that integration, stay with the auto complete here and the navigation back and forth
02:16.4 like this and so on. So just make sure that if you're working with uh
02:22.12 template files and you haven't set that or some reason you didn't go through a path
02:26.0 that automatically selected it like a new Flask.
02:28.42 Project, choosing the template language that you go over,
02:33.24 do language frameworks, templates and you set it to what you want it to be
