00:0.14 Recall our IDE Pyramid here we have PyCharm at the top.
00:4.24 But PyCharm also is built upon WebStorm and DataGrip.
00:8.64 So as I was saying before,
00:10.09 if you want to have a really first class 
00:13.13 IDE for working with web applications,
00:15.24 well, PyCharm is absolutely one of those because it has all the Web Storm
00:19.36 features and WebStorm itself is one of the very best web 
00:23.3 IDE's When we talk about the server side frameworks,
00:27.44 when we talk about Flask and Django and Fast API and Pyramid and so on,
00:32.74 we're going to be working with the features of PyCharm itself.
00:36.12 Right? We're riding the back end server side python code and may be working with
00:40.1 the templates and the way those things fit together at the same time.
00:43.52 Those will have a lot of front end features.
00:46.5 So client side web frameworks like Vue.js
00:49.37 potentially obviously straight html or html in the form of jinja template or something.
00:56.34 CSS, LESS, Typescript, Javascript, all of those things and all that support is coming
01:1.46 from the WebStorm side of things here.
01:3.99 So as we focus on the next two chapters,
01:6.97 we're going to be kind of inter plane between these two parts of this IDE Pyramid..
